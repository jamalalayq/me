## Brief:

With over a decade of experience in mobile application development, I have consistently sought to expand my knowledge by delving into various programming languages and technologies. I have successfully uploaded numerous applications to the App Store and have actively engaged in self-improvement through reading articles, watching videos, and attending WWDC conferences.
Although I have been involved in mobile app development since late 2012, I dedicated myself to mobile apps development in 2014. My expertise lies in server-side development, and I am committed to continuously honing my skills through these endeavors.

# Cover Letter:

My name is Jamal Alaayq, and I graduated in 2011 from the High Institute for Computers and Management Information Systems in the Information Systems department.

Since 2012, I have been developing mobile applications, initially using Windows Phone and C# programming language. After over a year, I transitioned to Swift and iOS development. In 2014, I commenced building my first mobile application.

Over the subsequent two years, I engaged in freelance iOS development to enhance my skills and gain experience in diverse technologies. Subsequently, I joined companies, where I contributed to the development of several applications.

My career commenced with Atiaf Apps Software House, where I developed a range of applications. I subsequently transitioned to Tech-World, a product-based company, where I developed the Dalil app, a mobile application comparable to TrueCaller. I subsequently joined OCS, a software house company, and Altawasol Co., where I focused on developing GIS technologies and creating applications related to maps, particularly working with Core Locations. Finally, I joined Mongez to develop a delivery application.

My expertise encompasses iOS development technologies, including UIKit, SwiftUI, User Notifications, Core Location, Maps, Animations, and various Foundation frameworks. Additionally, I am proficient in RxSwift, Alamofire, and other technologies. I have experience with architectural design patterns such as MVVM, MVC, and MVI. Furthermore, I adhere to the SOLID Principles and utilize CI/CD tools, particularly Git, to manage my projects and publish applications on the App Store.
Two years ago, I commenced developing Flutter applications utilizing the Dart programming language. Since 2023, I have been actively involved in the US marketplace, contributing to the creation and publication of numerous applications. During this period, I have acquired a diverse skill set.
To enhance my productivity, I employ various tools, including Git, GitHub, Fastlane, and numerous CI/CD tools. I adhere to software design techniques such as DRY, KISS, and SOLID to construct maintainable and readable codebases. I am an avid learner and continuously strive to improve my skills. In the end, I am actively working on enhancing my English communication abilities.
